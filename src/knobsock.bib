  abstract = {Diagnostic and surgical strategies could benefit from accurate localization
	of liver malignancies via CT-FDG-PET image registration. However,
	registration uncertainty occurs due to protocol differences in data-acquisition,
	the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET)
	and the low uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in normal liver
	tissue. To assess this uncertainty, methods were presented to estimate
	registration precision and systematic bias. A semi-automatic, organ-focused
	method was investigated to minimize the uncertainty well beyond the
	typical uncertainty of 5-10 mm obtained by commonly available methods.
	By restricting registration to the liver region and by isolating
	the liver on computed tomography (CT) from surrounding structures
	using a thresholding technique, registration was achieved using the
	mutual information-based method as implemented in insight toolkit
	(ITK). CT and FDG-PET images of 10 patients with liver metastases
	were registered rigidly a number of times. Results of the organ-focused
	method were compared to results of three commonly available methods
	(a manual, a landmark-based and a 'standard' mutual information-based
	method) where no dedicated image processing was performed. The proposed
	method outperformed the other methods with a precision (mean+/-s.d.)
	of 2.5+/-1.3 mm and a bias of 1.9 mm with a 95\% CI of [1.0, 2.8]
	mm. Unlike the commonly available methods, our approach allows for
	robust CT-FDG-PET registration of the liver, with an accuracy better
	than the spatial resolution of the PET scanner that was used.},

  abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant
	support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

  abstract = {Existing approaches to computational anatomy assume that a perfectly
	conforming diffeomorphism applied to an anatomy of interest captures
	its morphological characteristics relative to a template. However,
	the amount of biological variability in a groupwise analysis renders
	this task practically impossible, due to the nonexistence of a single
	template that matches all anatomies in an ensemble, even if such
	a template is constructed by group averaging procedures. Consequently,
	anatomical characteristics not captured by the transformation, and
	which are left out in the residual image, are lost permanently from
	subsequent analysis, if only properties of the transformation are
	examined. This paper extends our recent work [Makrogiannis, S., Verma,
	R., Davatzikos, C., 2007. Anatomical equivalence class: a computational
	anatomy framework using a lossless shape descriptor. IEEE Trans.
	Biomed. Imag. 26(4), 619-631] on characterizing subtle morphological
	variations via a lossless morphological descriptor that takes the
	residual into account along with the transformation. Since there
	are infinitely many [transformation, residual] pairs that reconstruct
	a given anatomy, we treat them as members of an Anatomical Equivalence
	Class (AEC), thereby forming a manifold embedded in the space spanned
	by [transformation, residual]. This paper develops a unique and optimal
	representation of each anatomy that is estimated from the corresponding
	AECs by solving a global optimization problem. This effectively determines
	the optimal template and transformation parameters for each individual
	anatomy, and eliminates respective confounding variation in the data.
	It, therefore, constitutes the second novelty, in that it represents
	a group-wise optimal registration strategy that individually adjusts
	the template and the smoothness of the transformation according to
	each anatomy. Experimental results support the superiority of our
	morphological analysis framework over conventional analysis, and
	demonstrate better diagnostic accuracy.},

	applied cortical pattern matching and new methods for measuring cortical
	thickness in millimeters to structural magnetic resonance images
	of 21 children with confirmed 22q11.2 deletions and 13 demographically
	matched healthy comparison subjects. Thickness was mapped at 65 536

	boundary. A pattern of regionally specific cortical thinning was
	observed in superior parietal cortices and right parietooccipital
	cortex, regions critical for visuospatial processing, and bilaterally
	in the most inferior portion of the inferior frontal gyrus (pars
	orbitalis), a key area for language development. Several of the 30
	genes encoded in the deleted segment are highly expressed in the

  volume = {35},
  pages = {81--88},
  number = {1},
  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {Inversion of deformation fields is applied frequently to map images,
	dose, and contours between the reference frame and the study frame.
	A prevailing approach that takes the negative of the forward deformation
	as the inverse deformation is oversimplified and can cause large
	errors for large deformations or deformations that are composites
	of several deformations. Other approaches, including Newton's method
	and scatter data interpolation, either require the first derivative
	or are very inefficient. Here we propose an iterative approach that
	is easy to implement, converges quickly to the inverse when it does,
	and works for a majority of cases in practice. Our approach is rooted
	in fixed-point theory. We build a sequence to approximate the inverse
	deformation through iterative evaluation of the forward deformation.
	A sufficient but not necessary convergence condition (Lipschitz condition)
	and its proof are also given. Though this condition guarantees the
	convergence, it may not be met for an arbitrary deformation field.
	One should always check whether the inverse exists for the given
	forward deformation field by calculating its Jacobian. If nonpositive
	values of the Jacobian occur only for few voxels, this method will
	usually converge to a pseudoinverse. In case the iteration fails
	to converge, one should switch to other means of finding the inverse.
	We tested the proposed method on simulated 2D data and real 3D computed
	tomography data of a lung patient and compared our method with two
	implementations in the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
	(ITK). Typically less than ten iterations are needed for our method
	to get an inverse deformation field with clinically relevant accuracy.
	Based on the test results, our method is about ten times faster and
	yet ten times more accurate than ITK's iterative method for the same
	number of iterations. Simulations and real data tests demonstrated
	the efficacy and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging with an endorectal coil allows high-resolution
	imaging of prostate cancer and the surrounding normal organs. These
	anatomic details can be used to direct radiotherapy. However, organ
	deformation introduced by the endorectal coil makes it difficult
	to register magnetic resonance images for treatment planning. In
	this study, plug-ins for the volume visualization software VolView
	were implemented on the basis of algorithms from the National Library
	of Medicine's Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).Magnetic
	resonance images of a phantom simulating human pelvic structures
	were obtained with and without the endorectal coil balloon inflated.
	The prostate not deformed by the endorectal balloon was registered
	to the deformed prostate using an ITK thin plate spline (TPS). This
	plug-in allows the use of crop planes to limit the deformable registration
	in the region of interest around the prostate. These crop planes
	restricted the support of the TPS to the area around the prostate,
	where most of the deformation occurred. The region outside the crop
	planes was anchored by grid points.The TPS was more accurate in registering
	the local deformation of the prostate compared with a TPS variant,
	the elastic body spline. The TPS was also applied to register an
	in vivo T(2)-weighted endorectal magnetic resonance image. The intraprostatic
	tumor was accurately registered. This could potentially guide the
	boosting of intraprostatic targets. The source and target landmarks
	were placed graphically. This TPS plug-in allows the registration
	to be undone. The landmarks could be added, removed, and adjusted
	in real time and in three dimensions between repeated registrations.This
	interactive TPS plug-in allows a user to obtain a high level of accuracy
	satisfactory to a specific application efficiently. Because it is
	open-source software, the imaging community will be able to validate
	and improve the algorithm.},

  abstract = {A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local
	shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional
	(3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar
	target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying
	a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate
	system of the template while constraining the transformation to be
	smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed
	without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small
	subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian
	limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs
	fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based
	on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining
	the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations.
	Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity
	of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included
	in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings
	are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential
	equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic
	regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear

  pages = {186--197},
  abstract = {The vervet monkey is an important nonhuman primate model that allows
	the study of isolated environmental factors in a controlled environment.
	Analysis of monkey MRI often suffers from lower quality images compared
	with human MRI because clinical equipment is typically used to image
	the smaller monkey brain and higher spatial resolution is required.
	This, together with the anatomical differences of the monkey brains,
	complicates the use of neuroimage analysis pipelines tuned for human
	MRI analysis. In this paper we developed an open source image analysis
	framework based on the tools available within the 3D Slicer software
	to support a biological study that investigates the effect of chronic
	ethanol exposure on brain morphometry in a longitudinally followed
	population of male vervets. We first developed a computerized atlas
	of vervet monkey brain MRI, which was used to encode the typical
	appearance of the individual brain structures in MRI and their spatial
	distribution. The atlas was then used as a spatial prior during automatic
	segmentation to process two longitudinal scans per subject. Our evaluation
	confirms the consistency and reliability of the automatic segmentation.
	The comparison of atlas construction strategies reveals that the
	use of a population-specific atlas leads to improved accuracy of
	the segmentation for subcortical brain structures. The contribution
	of this work is twofold. First, we describe an image processing workflow
	specifically tuned towards the analysis of vervet MRI that consists
	solely of the open source software tools. Second, we develop a digital
	atlas of vervet monkey brain MRIs to enable similar studies that
	rely on the vervet model.},

	evaluated at the Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany. The first
	results were gathered with an application implemented for the Neurosurgical
	Department of the hospital. In these tests the framework concept,
	along with its specific tools, was very promising for establishing

	The ability to automatically optimize the parameterization of registration

  abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis
	and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully
	automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration
	methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common
	mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date
	little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself,
	even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the
	quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions
	underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal
	voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local
	optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution
	approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To
	address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that
	is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion
	of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is
	an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are
	presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments
	that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the
	global minimum than several of the currently available registration
	packages in common usage.},

  abstract = {Fully-automated brain segmentation methods have not been widely adopted
	for clinical use because of issues related to reliability, accuracy,
	and limitations of delineation protocol. By combining the probabilistic-based
	FreeSurfer (FS) method with the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric
	Mapping (LDDMM)-based label-propagation method, we are able to increase
	reliability and accuracy, and allow for flexibility in template choice.
	Our method uses the automated FreeSurfer subcortical labeling to
	provide a coarse-to-fine introduction of information in the LDDMM
	template-based segmentation resulting in a fully-automated subcortical
	brain segmentation method (FS+LDDMM). One major advantage of the
	FS+LDDMM-based approach is that the automatically generated segmentations
	generated are inherently smooth, thus subsequent steps in shape analysis
	can directly follow without manual post-processing or loss of detail.
	We have evaluated our new FS+LDDMM method on several databases containing
	a total of 50 subjects with different pathologies, scan sequences
	and manual delineation protocols for labeling the basal ganglia,
	thalamus, and hippocampus. In healthy controls we report Dice overlap
	measures of 0.81, 0.83, 0.74, 0.86 and 0.75 for the right caudate
	nucleus, putamen, pallidum, thalamus and hippocampus respectively.
	We also find statistically significant improvement of accuracy in
	FS+LDDMM over FreeSurfer for the caudate nucleus and putamen of Huntington's
	disease and Tourette's syndrome subjects, and the right hippocampus
	of Schizophrenia subjects.},

  abstract = {We propose a framework for the nonlinear spatiotemporal registration
	of 4D time-series of images based on the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD)
	algorithm. In this framework, the 4D spatiotemporal registration
	is decoupled into a 4D temporal registration, defined as mapping
	physiological states, and a 4D spatial registration, defined as mapping
	trajectories of physical points. Our contribution focuses more specifically
	on the 4D spatial registration that should be consistent over time
	as opposed to 3D registration that solely aims at mapping homologous
	points at a given time-point. First, we estimate in each sequence
	the motion displacement field, which is a dense representation of
	the point trajectories we want to register. Then, we perform simultaneously
	3D registrations of corresponding time-points with the constraints
	to map the same physical points over time called the trajectory constraints.
	Under these constraints, we show that the 4D spatial registration
	can be formulated as a multichannel registration of 3D images. To
	solve it, we propose a novel version of the Diffeomorphic Demons
	(DD) algorithm extended to vector-valued 3D images, the Multichannel
	Diffeomorphic Demons (MDD). For evaluation, this framework is applied
	to the registration of 4D cardiac computed tomography (CT) sequences
	and compared to other standard methods with real patient data and
	synthetic data simulated from a physiologically realistic electromechanical
	cardiac model. Results show that the trajectory constraints act as
	a temporal regularization consistent with motion whereas the multichannel
	registration acts as a spatial regularization. Finally, using these
	trajectory constraints with multichannel registration yields the
	best compromise between registration accuracy, temporal and spatial
	smoothness, and computation times. A prospective example of application
	is also presented with the spatiotemporal registration of 4D cardiac
	CT sequences of the same patient before and after radiofrequency
	ablation (RFA) in case of atrial fibrillation (AF). The intersequence
	spatial transformations over a cardiac cycle allow to analyze and
	quantify the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and its impact
	on the cardiac function.},

  abstract = {Thoroughly designed, open-source toolkits emerge to boost progress
	in medical imaging. The Insight Toolkit (ITK) provides this for the
	algorithmic scope of medical imaging, especially for segmentation
	and registration. But medical imaging algorithms have to be clinically
	applied to be useful, which additionally requires visualization and
	interaction. The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) has powerful visualization
	capabilities, but only low-level support for interaction. In this
	paper, we present the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK).
	The goal of MITK is to significantly reduce the effort required to
	construct specifically tailored, interactive applications for medical
	image analysis. MITK allows an easy combination of algorithms developed
	by ITK with visualizations created by VTK and extends these two toolkits
	with those features, which are outside the scope of both. MITK adds
	support for complex interactions with multiple states as well as
	undo-capabilities, a very important prerequisite for convenient user
	interfaces. Furthermore, MITK facilitates the realization of multiple,
	different views of the same data (as a multiplanar reconstruction
	and a 3D rendering) and supports the visualization of 3D+t data,
	whereas VTK is only designed to create one kind of view of 2D or
	3D data. MITK reuses virtually everything from ITK and VTK. Thus,
	it is not at all a competitor to ITK or VTK, but an extension, which
	eases the combination of both and adds the features required for
	interactive, convenient to use medical imaging software. MITK is
	an open-source project (www.mitk.org).},

  abstract = {We present the detailed planning and execution of the Insight Toolkit
	(ITK), an application programmers interface (API) for the segmentation
	and registration of medical image data. This public resource has
	been developed through the NLM Visible Human Project, and is in beta
	test as an open-source software offering under cost-free licensing.
	The toolkit concentrates on 3D medical data segmentation and registration
	algorithms, multimodal and multiresolution capabilities, and portable
	platform independent support for Windows, Linux/Unix systems. This
	toolkit was built using current practices in software engineering.
	Specifically, we embraced the concept of generic programming during
	the development of these tools, working extensively with C++ templates
	and the freedom and flexibility they allow. Software development
	tools for distributed consortium-based code development have been
	created and are also publicly available. We discuss our assumptions,
	design decisions, and some lessons learned.},
