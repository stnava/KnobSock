  abstract = {Diagnostic and surgical strategies could benefit from accurate localization
	of liver malignancies via CT-FDG-PET image registration. However,
	registration uncertainty occurs due to protocol differences in data-acquisition,
	the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET)
	and the low uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in normal liver
	tissue. To assess this uncertainty, methods were presented to estimate
	registration precision and systematic bias. A semi-automatic, organ-focused
	method was investigated to minimize the uncertainty well beyond the
	typical uncertainty of 5-10 mm obtained by commonly available methods.
	By restricting registration to the liver region and by isolating
	the liver on computed tomography (CT) from surrounding structures
	using a thresholding technique, registration was achieved using the
	mutual information-based method as implemented in insight toolkit
	(ITK). CT and FDG-PET images of 10 patients with liver metastases
	were registered rigidly a number of times. Results of the organ-focused
	method were compared to results of three commonly available methods
	(a manual, a landmark-based and a 'standard' mutual information-based
	method) where no dedicated image processing was performed. The proposed
	method outperformed the other methods with a precision (mean+/-s.d.)
	of 2.5+/-1.3 mm and a bias of 1.9 mm with a 95\% CI of [1.0, 2.8]
	mm. Unlike the commonly available methods, our approach allows for
	robust CT-FDG-PET registration of the liver, with an accuracy better
	than the spatial resolution of the PET scanner that was used.},

  abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant
	support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

  abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source
	segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs).
	The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using
	the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of
	the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric
	finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
	probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
	Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented
	to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
	section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint.
	This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos
	and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets.
	First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute
	to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means
	segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with
	initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template;
	(3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
	maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance
	by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem
	derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These
	evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise
	Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability
	of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

  abstract = {Existing approaches to computational anatomy assume that a perfectly
	conforming diffeomorphism applied to an anatomy of interest captures
	its morphological characteristics relative to a template. However,
	the amount of biological variability in a groupwise analysis renders
	this task practically impossible, due to the nonexistence of a single
	template that matches all anatomies in an ensemble, even if such
	a template is constructed by group averaging procedures. Consequently,
	anatomical characteristics not captured by the transformation, and
	which are left out in the residual image, are lost permanently from
	subsequent analysis, if only properties of the transformation are
	examined. This paper extends our recent work [Makrogiannis, S., Verma,
	R., Davatzikos, C., 2007. Anatomical equivalence class: a computational
	anatomy framework using a lossless shape descriptor. IEEE Trans.
	Biomed. Imag. 26(4), 619-631] on characterizing subtle morphological
	variations via a lossless morphological descriptor that takes the
	residual into account along with the transformation. Since there
	are infinitely many [transformation, residual] pairs that reconstruct
	a given anatomy, we treat them as members of an Anatomical Equivalence
	Class (AEC), thereby forming a manifold embedded in the space spanned
	by [transformation, residual]. This paper develops a unique and optimal
	representation of each anatomy that is estimated from the corresponding
	AECs by solving a global optimization problem. This effectively determines
	the optimal template and transformation parameters for each individual
	anatomy, and eliminates respective confounding variation in the data.
	It, therefore, constitutes the second novelty, in that it represents
	a group-wise optimal registration strategy that individually adjusts
	the template and the smoothness of the transformation according to
	each anatomy. Experimental results support the superiority of our
	morphological analysis framework over conventional analysis, and
	demonstrate better diagnostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {Due to the complexity of 4D target tracking radiotherapy, the accuracy
	of this treatment strategy should be experimentally validated against
	established standard 3D technique. This work compared the accuracy
	of 3D and 4D dose calculations in respiration tracking stereotactic
	body radiotherapy (SBRT).Using the 4D planning module of the CyberKnife
	treatment planning system, treatment plans for a moving target and
	a static off-target cord structure were created on different four-dimensional
	computed tomography (4D-CT) datasets of a thorax phantom moving in
	different ranges. The 4D planning system used B-splines deformable
	image registrations (DIR) to accumulate dose distributions calculated
	on different breathing geometries, each corresponding to a static
	3D-CT image of the 4D-CT dataset, onto a reference image to compose
	a 4D dose distribution. For each motion, 4D optimization was performed
	to generate a 4D treatment plan of the moving target. For comparison
	with standard 3D planning, each 4D plan was copied to the reference
	end-exhale images and a standard 3D dose calculation was followed.
	Treatment plans of the off-target structure were first obtained by
	standard 3D optimization on the end-exhale images. Subsequently,
	they were applied to recalculate the 4D dose distributions using
	DIRs. All dose distributions that were initially obtained using the
	ray-tracing algorithm with equivalent path-length heterogeneity correction
	(3D EPL and 4D EPL) were recalculated by a Monte Carlo algorithm
	(3D MC and 4D MC) to further investigate the effects of dose calculation
	algorithms. The calculated 3D EPL, 3D MC, 4D EPL, and 4D MC dose
	distributions were compared to measurements by Gafchromic EBT2 films
	in the axial and coronal planes of the moving target object, and
	the coronal plane for the static off-target object based on the ?
	metric at 5\%/3mm criteria (?5\%/3mm). Treatment plans were considered
	acceptable if the percentage of pixels passing ?5\%/3mm (P?<1) ?
	90\%.The averaged P?<1 values of the 3D EPL, 3D MC, 4D EPL, and 4D
	MC dose calculation methods for the moving target plans are 95\%,
	95\%, 94\%, and 95\% for reproducible motion, and 95\%, 96\%, 94\%,
	and 93\% for nonreproducible motion during actual treatment delivery.
	The overall measured target dose distributions are in better agreement
	with the 3DMC dose distributions than the 4DMC dose distributions.
	Conversely, measured dose distributions agree much better with the
	4D EPL/MC than the 3D EPL/MC dose distributions in the static off-target
	structure, resulting in higher P?<1 values with 4D EPL/MC (91\%)
	vs 3D EPL (24\%) and 3D MC (25\%). Systematic changes of target motion
	reduced the averaged P?<1 to 47\% and 53\% for 4D EPL and 4D MC dose
	calculations, and 22\% for 3D EPL/MC dose calculations in the off-target
	films.In robotic tracking SBRT, 4D treatment planning was found to
	yield better prediction of the dose distributions in the off-target
	structure, but not necessarily in the moving target, compared to
	standard 3D treatment planning, for reproducible and nonreproducible
	target motion. It is important to ensure on a patient-by-patient
	basis that the cumulative uncertainty associated with the 4D-CT artifacts,
	deformable image registration, and motion variability is significantly
	smaller than the cumulative uncertainty occurred in standard 3D planning
	in order to make 4D planning a justified option.},

  pages = {81--88},
  number = {1},
  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {Inversion of deformation fields is applied frequently to map images,
	dose, and contours between the reference frame and the study frame.
	A prevailing approach that takes the negative of the forward deformation
	as the inverse deformation is oversimplified and can cause large
	errors for large deformations or deformations that are composites
	of several deformations. Other approaches, including Newton's method
	and scatter data interpolation, either require the first derivative
	or are very inefficient. Here we propose an iterative approach that
	is easy to implement, converges quickly to the inverse when it does,
	and works for a majority of cases in practice. Our approach is rooted
	in fixed-point theory. We build a sequence to approximate the inverse
	deformation through iterative evaluation of the forward deformation.
	A sufficient but not necessary convergence condition (Lipschitz condition)
	and its proof are also given. Though this condition guarantees the
	convergence, it may not be met for an arbitrary deformation field.
	One should always check whether the inverse exists for the given
	forward deformation field by calculating its Jacobian. If nonpositive
	values of the Jacobian occur only for few voxels, this method will
	usually converge to a pseudoinverse. In case the iteration fails
	to converge, one should switch to other means of finding the inverse.
	We tested the proposed method on simulated 2D data and real 3D computed
	tomography data of a lung patient and compared our method with two
	implementations in the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
	(ITK). Typically less than ten iterations are needed for our method
	to get an inverse deformation field with clinically relevant accuracy.
	Based on the test results, our method is about ten times faster and
	yet ten times more accurate than ITK's iterative method for the same
	number of iterations. Simulations and real data tests demonstrated
	the efficacy and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},

	this study, plug-ins for the volume visualization software VolView
	were implemented on the basis of algorithms from the National Library
	of Medicine's Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).Magnetic
	resonance images of a phantom simulating human pelvic structures
	were obtained with and without the endorectal coil balloon inflated.
	The prostate not deformed by the endorectal balloon was registered
	to the deformed prostate using an ITK thin plate spline (TPS). This
	plug-in allows the use of crop planes to limit the deformable registration
	in the region of interest around the prostate. These crop planes
	restricted the support of the TPS to the area around the prostate,
	where most of the deformation occurred. The region outside the crop
	planes was anchored by grid points.The TPS was more accurate in registering
	the local deformation of the prostate compared with a TPS variant,
	the elastic body spline. The TPS was also applied to register an
	in vivo T(2)-weighted endorectal magnetic resonance image. The intraprostatic
	tumor was accurately registered. This could potentially guide the
	boosting of intraprostatic targets. The source and target landmarks
	were placed graphically. This TPS plug-in allows the registration
	to be undone. The landmarks could be added, removed, and adjusted
	in real time and in three dimensions between repeated registrations.This
	interactive TPS plug-in allows a user to obtain a high level of accuracy
	satisfactory to a specific application efficiently. Because it is
	open-source software, the imaging community will be able to validate
	and improve the algorithm.},

  abstract = {A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local
	shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional
	(3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar
	target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying
	a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate
	system of the template while constraining the transformation to be
	smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed
	without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small
	subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian
	limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs
	fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based
	on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining
	the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations.
	Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity
	of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included
	in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings
	are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential
	equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic
	regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear
	transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application
	of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures
	illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.},

  abstract = {The vervet monkey is an important nonhuman primate model that allows
	the study of isolated environmental factors in a controlled environment.
	Analysis of monkey MRI often suffers from lower quality images compared
	with human MRI because clinical equipment is typically used to image
	the smaller monkey brain and higher spatial resolution is required.
	This, together with the anatomical differences of the monkey brains,
	complicates the use of neuroimage analysis pipelines tuned for human
	MRI analysis. In this paper we developed an open source image analysis
	framework based on the tools available within the 3D Slicer software
	to support a biological study that investigates the effect of chronic
	ethanol exposure on brain morphometry in a longitudinally followed
	population of male vervets. We first developed a computerized atlas
	of vervet monkey brain MRI, which was used to encode the typical
	appearance of the individual brain structures in MRI and their spatial
	distribution. The atlas was then used as a spatial prior during automatic
	segmentation to process two longitudinal scans per subject. Our evaluation
	confirms the consistency and reliability of the automatic segmentation.
	The comparison of atlas construction strategies reveals that the
	use of a population-specific atlas leads to improved accuracy of
	the segmentation for subcortical brain structures. The contribution
	of this work is twofold. First, we describe an image processing workflow
	specifically tuned towards the analysis of vervet MRI that consists
	solely of the open source software tools. Second, we develop a digital
	atlas of vervet monkey brain MRIs to enable similar studies that
	rely on the vervet model.},

	the establishment, evaluation and comparison of registration approaches.
	Flexible registration and evaluation engine (f.r.e.e.) achieves a
	broad basis of algorithms by utilizing the insight segmentation and
	registration toolkit (ITK). This basis can be extended by virtually
	any new approach or algorithm, which then becomes seamlessly integrated
	into the method set of the f.r.e.e. framework. The framework offers
	suitable tools for an easy integration, optimization and proper evaluation
	of registration approaches, as well as an efficient utilization of
	the results in clinical routine. The framework is currently being
	evaluated at the Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany. The first
	results were gathered with an application implemented for the Neurosurgical
	Department of the hospital. In these tests the framework concept,
	along with its specific tools, was very promising for establishing
	clinical applications (e.g. preoperative neurosurgical planning;
	registration of cardiac images) and therefore motivated further development.
	The ability to automatically optimize the parameterization of registration
	methods regarding a given test set also proved useful, allowing more
	concentration on scientific problems themselves and not on the laborious

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate patient to image registration is the core for
	successful image-guided neurosurgery. While skin adhesive markers
	(SMs) are widely used in point-matching registration, a proper implementation
	of anatomical landmarks (ALs) may overcome the inconvenience brought
	by the use of SMs. METHODS: Using nine ALs, a set of three configurations
	of different combinations of them is proposed. These configurations
	are defined according to the required positioning of the patient's
	head during surgery and the resulting distribution of the expected
	target registration error (TRE). These configurations were first
	evaluated by simulation experiment using the data of 20 patients
	from two hospitals, and then testing the applicability of them in
	eight real clinical surgeries of neuronavigation. RESULTS: The results
	of the simulation experiment showed that, by incorporating a fiducial
	registration error (FRE) of 3.5 mm measured in the clinical setting,
	the expected TRE in the whole skull was less than 2.5 mm, and the
	expected TRE in the whole brain was less than 1.75 mm when using
	all the nine ALs. A small TRE could also be achieved in the corresponding
	surgical field by using the other three configurations with less
	ALs. In the clinical experiment, the FLE ranges in the image and
	the patient space were 1.4-3.6 mm and 1.6-5.5 mm, respectively. The
	measured TRE and FRE were 3.1?±?0.75 mm and 3.5?±?0.17 mm, respectively.
	CONCLUSIONS: The AL configurations proposed in this investigation
	provide sufficient registration accuracy and can help to avoid the
	disadvantages of SMs if used clinically. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley

  abstract = {We propose a framework for the nonlinear spatiotemporal registration
	of 4D time-series of images based on the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD)
	algorithm. In this framework, the 4D spatiotemporal registration
	is decoupled into a 4D temporal registration, defined as mapping
	physiological states, and a 4D spatial registration, defined as mapping
	trajectories of physical points. Our contribution focuses more specifically
	on the 4D spatial registration that should be consistent over time
	as opposed to 3D registration that solely aims at mapping homologous
	points at a given time-point. First, we estimate in each sequence
	the motion displacement field, which is a dense representation of
	the point trajectories we want to register. Then, we perform simultaneously
	3D registrations of corresponding time-points with the constraints
	to map the same physical points over time called the trajectory constraints.
	Under these constraints, we show that the 4D spatial registration
	can be formulated as a multichannel registration of 3D images. To
	solve it, we propose a novel version of the Diffeomorphic Demons
	(DD) algorithm extended to vector-valued 3D images, the Multichannel
	Diffeomorphic Demons (MDD). For evaluation, this framework is applied
	to the registration of 4D cardiac computed tomography (CT) sequences
	and compared to other standard methods with real patient data and
	synthetic data simulated from a physiologically realistic electromechanical
	cardiac model. Results show that the trajectory constraints act as
	a temporal regularization consistent with motion whereas the multichannel
	registration acts as a spatial regularization. Finally, using these
	trajectory constraints with multichannel registration yields the
	best compromise between registration accuracy, temporal and spatial
	smoothness, and computation times. A prospective example of application
	is also presented with the spatiotemporal registration of 4D cardiac
	CT sequences of the same patient before and after radiofrequency
	ablation (RFA) in case of atrial fibrillation (AF). The intersequence
	spatial transformations over a cardiac cycle allow to analyze and
	quantify the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and its impact
	on the cardiac function.},

	with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the
	fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI
	in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results

  abstract = {We describe the construction of a digital brain atlas composed of
	data from manually delineated MRI data. A total of 56 structures
	were labeled in MRI of 40 healthy, normal volunteers. This labeling
	was performed according to a set of protocols developed for this
	project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained
	on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for
	concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability
	standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34
	brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates
	using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al.,
	1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's
	FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped
	version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation
	method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical
	brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants
	of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples
	of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For
	each normalization algorithm, the individual structure delineations
	were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We
	next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability
	of that voxel belonging to each of the 56 structures. Each version
	of the atlas contains, for every voxel, probability densities for
	each region, thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic
	labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces;
	we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps
	based on the three methods and target spaces. These atlases will
	serve as a resource for diverse applications including meta-analysis
	of functional and structural imaging data and other bioinformatics
	applications where display of arbitrary labels in probabilistically

  abstract = {We propose an efficient non-parametric diffeomorphic image registration
	algorithm based on Thirion's demons algorithm. In the first part

	as an optimization procedure on the entire space of displacement
	fields. We provide strong theoretical roots to the different variants
	of Thirion's demons algorithm. This analysis predicts a theoretical
	advantage for the symmetric forces variant of the demons algorithm.
	We show on controlled experiments that this advantage is confirmed
	in practice and yields a faster convergence. In the second part of

	algorithm to a space of diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast
	to many diffeomorphic registration algorithms, our solution is computationally
	efficient since in practice it only replaces an addition of displacement
	fields by a few compositions. Our experiments show that in addition
	to being diffeomorphic, our algorithm provides results that are similar

  abstract = {The objectives of the following research were to evaluate the utility
	of a deformable image registration technique known as hyperelastic
	warping for the measurement of local strains in the left ventricle
	through the analysis of clinical, gated PET image datasets. Two normal
	human male subjects were sequentially imaged with PET and tagged
	MRI imaging. Strain predictions were made for systolic contraction
	using warping analyses of the PET images and HARP based strain analyses
	of the MRI images. Coefficient of determination R (2) values were
	computed for the comparison of circumferential and radial strain
	predictions produced by each methodology. There was good correspondence
	between the methodologies, with R (2) values of 0.78 for the radial
	strains of both hearts and from an R (2) = 0.81 and R (2) = 0.83
	for the circumferential strains. The strain predictions were not
	statistically different (P ? 0.01). A series of sensitivity results
	indicated that the methodology was relatively insensitive to alterations
	in image intensity, random image noise, and alterations in fiber
	structure. This study demonstrated that warping was able to provide
	strain predictions of systolic contraction of the LV consistent with
	those provided by tagged MRI Warping.},

  journal = {J Transl Med},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {4},
  abstract = {The role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in chemoresistance
	is controversial; some studies showed a relationship between higher
	bFGF level and chemoresistance while other studies showed the opposite
	finding. The goal of the present study was to quantify bFGF levels
	in archived tumor tissues, and to determine its relationship with
	chemosensitivity.We established an image analysis-based method to
	quantify and convert the immunostaining intensity of intra-tumor
	bFGF to concentrations; this was accomplished by generating standard
	curves using human xenograft tumors as the renewable tissue source
	for simultaneous image analysis and ELISA. The relationships between
	bFGF concentrations and tumor chemosensitivity of patient tumors
	(n = 87) to paclitaxel were evaluated using linear regression analysis.The
	image analysis results were compared to our previous results obtained
	using a conventional, semi-quantitative visual scoring method. While
	both analyses indicated an inverse relationship between bFGF level
	and tumor sensitivity to paclitaxel, the image analysis method, by
	providing bFGF levels in individual tumors and therefore more data
	points (87 numerical values as opposed to four groups of staining
	intensities), further enabled the quantitative analysis of the relationship
	in subgroups of tumors with different pathobiological properties.
	The results show significant correlation between bFGF level and tumor
	sensitivity to the antiproliferation effect, but not the apoptotic
	effect, of paclitaxel. We further found stronger correlations of
	bFGF level and paclitaxel sensitivity in four tumor subgroups (high
	stage, positive p53 staining, negative aFGF staining, containing
	higher-than-median bFGF level), compared to all other groups. These
	findings suggest that the relationship between intra-tumoral bFGF
	level and paclitaxel sensitivity was context-dependent, which may
	explain the previous contradictory findings on the merit of using
	plasma or urine bFGF level as a prognostic indicator.The present
	study established a quantitative image analysis method that enabled
	the measurement of intratumoral bFGF level in archived tissues. The
	ability to quantify a potential biomarker provided the opportunity
	to study the relationship between the biomarker and chemosensitivity
	in tumor subgroups and thereby enabled hypothesis generation for
	additional translational research.},

	algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide
	variety of imaging devices. This approach works directly with image
	data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. This technique
	is, however, more flexible and robust than other intensity-based
	techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation
	that is based on stochastic approximation. Experiments are presented

  abstract = {Thoroughly designed, open-source toolkits emerge to boost progress
	in medical imaging. The Insight Toolkit (ITK) provides this for the

	applied to be useful, which additionally requires visualization and
	interaction. The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) has powerful visualization
	capabilities, but only low-level support for interaction. In this
	paper, we present the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK).
	The goal of MITK is to significantly reduce the effort required to
	construct specifically tailored, interactive applications for medical
	image analysis. MITK allows an easy combination of algorithms developed
	by ITK with visualizations created by VTK and extends these two toolkits
	with those features, which are outside the scope of both. MITK adds
	support for complex interactions with multiple states as well as
	undo-capabilities, a very important prerequisite for convenient user
	interfaces. Furthermore, MITK facilitates the realization of multiple,
	different views of the same data (as a multiplanar reconstruction
	and a 3D rendering) and supports the visualization of 3D+t data,
	whereas VTK is only designed to create one kind of view of 2D or
	3D data. MITK reuses virtually everything from ITK and VTK. Thus,
	it is not at all a competitor to ITK or VTK, but an extension, which
	eases the combination of both and adds the features required for
	interactive, convenient to use medical imaging software. MITK is
	an open-source project (www.mitk.org).},
